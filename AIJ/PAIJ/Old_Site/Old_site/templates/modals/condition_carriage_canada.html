        <h3>13.1 Acceptance for transportation </h3>
        <p>The carrier will make every effort to accommodate a passenger with a disability and will not refuse to transport a passenger solely based on his/her disability. In instances when refusing transportation to a passenger with a disability is necessary,

        <h3>13.3 Medical clearance</h3>
        <p>The carrier will not automatically require a medical clearance for persons with disabilities as a condition of travel. Rather, the carrier may, in good faith and using its reasonable discretion, determine that a person with a disability requires
            medical clearance where their safety or well-being, in terms of such things as assistance with eating, using the washroom facilities, or that of other passengers is in question. Where the carrier refuses to transport a passenger for such reasons,
            a written explanation will be provided at the time of refusal. When medical clearance is required the carrier may assess a person’s fitness to travel based on information and/or documentation submitted by the person with a disability (such

            as possible. Where a passenger requests a service less than 48 hours prior to departure, the carrier will make a reasonable effort to provide the service. </p>

        <h3>13.5 Accessible seating</h3>
        <p>The carrier will provide the person with a disability with the most accessible seat on the aircraft. For safety/security reasons some seats may not be available. Persons with disabilities and their attendants, who will meet the persons’ disability-related

            institution. For the comfort of all passengers, the carrier staff will determine, in consultation with the person with a disability, where the person and service animal will be seated. The carrier will assign a seat to the person who provides
            sufficient space for the person and the service animal and the carrier will permit the service animal to accompany the person on board the aircraft and to remain on the floor at the person’s passenger seat. Where there is insufficient floor
            space in the seat row of the person’s passenger seat, the carrier will permit the service animal to remain on the floor in area where the person can still exercise control over the animal.</p>

        <h3>13.8 Services to be provided to passengers with disabilities</h3>

        <h3>13.9 Boarding and Deplaning</h3>
        <p>Where a passenger with a disability requests assistance in boarding or seating or in stowing carry-on baggage, an air carrier will allow the person, upon request, to board the aircraft in advance of other passengers where time permits. The carrier
            may also require a person, even in the absence of a request to do so, to board the aircraft in advance of other passengers in order that it has sufficient time to provide the requested assistance.</p>

        <h3>13.10 Communication and confirmation of information </h3>
        <p>Announcements to passengers concerning stops, delays, schedule changes, connections, on-board services and claiming of baggage will be made in visual, verbal and/or written format to persons with disabilities who request such a service. The carrier

        <p>Flights appearing on the passenger’s itinerary receipt and in the carrier’s database must be used in sequence from the place of departure as shown on the passenger’s ticket. Each flight coupon will be accepted for transportation in the class of
            service on the date and flight for which space has been reserved.</p>

        <h3>19.6 Prohibited Practices</h3>
        <p>The carrier specifically prohibits the practice commonly known as <strong>Hidden City or Point Beyond Ticketing</strong>, the purchase of a Fare from a point before the passenger’s actual point of origin or to a point beyond the passenger’s actual
            destination. Use of this practice will result in the passenger’s reservation being cancelled and the passenger will not be entitled to a refund.</p>

        <h3>19.7 Invalidated tickets</h3>
        <p>If the passenger attempts to circumvent any term or condition of sale or the carrier determines that the passenger is making use of any of the prohibited practices specified in <a href="#rule19">Rule 19.7</a> above, this will cause the passenger’s
            ticket to be invalid and the carrier will have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancel any remaining portion of the passenger’s itinerary.</li>
            <li>Confiscate unused flight coupons</li>

            <dd>Under no circumstances will the carrier be liable for the loss, delay or damage to the checked or unchecked baggage not attributed to the negligence of the carrier, or that of its servants or agents. Assistance rendered to the passenger by
                the carrier’s employees in loading, unloading or trans-shipping of checked and unchecked baggage shall be considered as a gratuitous service to the passenger.</dd>
            <dd>The carrier is not liable for damage to the passenger’s baggage caused by property contained in the passenger’s baggage. Any passenger whose property caused damage to another passenger’s Baggage or to the property of the carrier shall indemnify
                the carrier for all losses and expenses incurred by the carrier as a result thereof.</dd>
            <dd>The carrier is liable for the damage sustained in case of destruction or loss of, or damage to, checked baggage upon condition only that the event which caused the destruction, loss or damage took place on board the aircraft or during any
                period within which the checked baggage was in the charge of the carrier. However, the carrier shall not be liable for the destruction, loss, damage or delay in delivery in any property which is not acceptable for transportation in accordance
                with Rule 10 (baggage) or for any other loss or damage of whatever nature resulting from any such loss or damage or from the transportation of such property, including damage or delay to perishable items, valuables, or loss or delay of
                unsuitably or inadequately packed items, to the extent that the destruction, loss or damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage, or in case of delay, that the carrier, its agents and servants took all measures
                that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was impossible to take such measures, This exclusion is applicable whether the non- acceptable property is included in the passenger’s checked baggage with or without the
                knowledge of the carrier. </dd>
            <dd>Further, the carrier’s liability for the destruction, loss, damage or delay of baggage is subject to the terms, limitations and defenses set forth in the Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Convention, whichever may apply, in addition to any
                limitation of defense recognized by a Court with proper jurisdiction over claim.</dd>
            <dd>The carrier reserves all defenses and limitations available under the Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Convention, whichever may apply to such claims including, but not limited to, the defense of Article 20 of the Warsaw Convention and Article
                19 of the Montreal Convention, and the exoneration defense of Article 21 of the Warsaw Convention and Article 20 of the Montreal Convention, except that the carrier shall not invoke Article 22 (2) and 22 (3) of the Warsaw Convention in
                a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 hereof. The limits of liability shall not apply in cases described in Article 25 of the Warsaw Convention or Article 22 (5) of the Montreal Convention, whichever may apply.</dd>

                    <li>When a portion of the trip has been used, the amount of the unused portion will be prorated based on mileage. </li>
                    <li>When a schedule irregularity within the carrier’s control results in the passenger being seated in a lower class of service than that purchased, the carrier will refund the value of the higher class fare applicable to that flight.</li>
