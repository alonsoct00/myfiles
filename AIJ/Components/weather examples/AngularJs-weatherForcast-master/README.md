# AngularJs-weatherForcast

#What: 
This app shows the user the current weather cast details of any chosen city around the world filtered by number of days (2, 5 or 7).

#Technologies:
In this project I was trying out new development technologies(for me...) that I learn by myself, such as the (combination) use of:
 - AngularJs,
 - Google maps [places] API
 - Open-Weather map API

#What's next?
I will try to make improvements as much as my little knowledge and experience lets me :)
- Create "save to Favorites" code-block (Should I use LocalStorage for this matter?)
- Show the "real" saved weathercasts in fav.html
- GUI design suggestions



Any useful tips/comments will be welcomed.
Thanks.
